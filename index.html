  <b>Growing up is hard</b>, having no motivation to do anything is even harder, and then having depression on top of it? Insurmountable. <br> But for Maggie? She's getting through it, one meeting with her therapist and wacky adventure with friends at a time.

        <b>Gay people are cool part 2: Electric Boogaloo.</b> Like Dogs on Dates, this webcomic follows a lovestruck goat and crocodile go through the motions of young love and chill adventures. <br> Right now in the comic there's even a side story call "Puppy Love"! This story too will have you saying "huh... gay people are cool."

      <h4>
        There are so much more comics that I didn't include because I don't want this website to be the same length as the leaked FBI papers. <br> In short though, art is great! And you should interact with a lot of different versions and calibers of art, even if it seems "corny or wierd"!
